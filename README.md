PredictionProject
=================

This repo contains my preiction project submission for the Coursera course Practical Machine Learning course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization. The following files are contained:

    PredictionProject.Rmd is an R Markdown file that generates the HTML document that describes the analysis.
    PredictionProjectact.html is an html file that is generated from the markdown file. On my MacBook Pro (I7 16 GB RAM) this takes approximately 5 minutes to execute.
